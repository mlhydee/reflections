When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So that there is a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may not have commited changes that you want on your local machine/vice versa.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks clone a copy of another repo from github, clones clone a repo from your local machine and branches are modified copies of a part of
the file which once was considered the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Incase the copy on github is changed, it is a way to back up your work.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Collaborate using code etc. It would be easier because of pull requests, but it can become quite a tedious amount of work after a while.
