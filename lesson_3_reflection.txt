When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So that there is a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may not have commited changes that you want on your local machine/vice versa.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks clone a copy of another repo from github, clones clone a repo from your local machine and branches are modified copies of a part of
the file which once was considered the master branch.
