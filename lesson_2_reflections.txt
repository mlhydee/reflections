What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository turns a standard directory into a git repo, where commits can be made to created files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a place to put files before they are committed. This is useful if you have a number of files that you
would like to commit together without committing them separately (e.g. html/css).
